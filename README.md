# ZEAI Viewer 

A small console program that reads the .zeai format, designed specifically for pixel art. The .zeai format holds as little information as possible, and therefore weighs less, which is an advantage of .zeai over .png or .jpg.

ZEAI Viewer will automatically randomly select a file with an appropriate extension to view from the 'view' folder.
