# ZEAI Viewer + Creator 

A small console program that reads the .zeai format, designed specifically for pixel art. The .zeai format holds as little information as possible, and therefore weighs less, which is an advantage of .zeai over .png or .jpg.

ZEAI Viewer will automatically randomly select a file with an appropriate extension to view from the 'view' folder.

## How to use ZEAI Opener

* Download the latest release
* Put the valid .zeai image in the 'view' folder
* Open main.exe

## How to use ZEAI Creator

* Download the latest release
* Place a valid .png image in the folder with the 'png2zeai.exe' app
* Rename your .png image to 'png2zeai.png'
* Open 'png2zeai.exe' app

## How to use ZEAI to PNG Converter

* Place a valid .zeai image to 'view' dir
* Open 'zeai2png.exe' app
* Enter the name of your image without the extension (e.g. if your image is "Cool pixel art.zeai" then write "Cool pixel art")
